### Project Description

The project implements the National Water Sector Plan, ensuring the elimination or mitigation of significant impacts of prevailing pressures and contributing to achieving good status of surface and marine waters. The initiative aligns with the Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. Key highlights include:

- Improving methods for assessing surface water bodies.
- Developing tools and methodologies for pressure and impact analysis.
- Setting environmental objectives using an ecosystem services approach.
- Testing and demonstrating measures to address pressures deteriorating water quality.
- Leveraging innovative technologies like remote sensing for pollution identification.

## Overview

The **Land Use Data Processing Pipeline** is a comprehensive Python-based workflow designed to process, analyze, and rasterize various land use datasets. It leverages powerful geospatial libraries to filter, clean, and merge vector data from multiple sources, ultimately producing a prioritized combined raster dataset. This pipeline is ideal for environmental analysis, urban planning, and geographic information system (GIS) applications.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Validation:** Efficiently loads and validates multiple GeoPackage layers and lookup tables.
- **Geometry Cleaning:** Removes duplicate and invalid geometries, ensuring data integrity.
- **Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Management:** Ensures all spatial data layers share a consistent CRS.
- **Priority-Based Union:** Merges multiple layers based on predefined priority to resolve overlaps.
- **Rasterization:** Converts vector data into raster format with customizable resolution.
- **Combined Raster Output:** Generates a single raster dataset that integrates all processed layers based on priority.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Tracks processing steps and errors for easy debugging and monitoring.
- **Memory Management:** Utilizes garbage collection to optimize memory usage during processing.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the pipeline, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
